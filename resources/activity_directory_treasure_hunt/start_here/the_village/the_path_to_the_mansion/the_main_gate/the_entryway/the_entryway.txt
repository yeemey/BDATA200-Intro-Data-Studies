The Entryway
============

Unlit lanterns line the walls of the entryway. A stairway to the tower is straight ahead of you. To your left is a closed door marked 'The aParlor'. The carpet is coated with layer upon layer of dust. 

Curiously, the dust next to a very small section of wall to your right looks like it has been recently disturbed.  Perhaps a hidden passage?
