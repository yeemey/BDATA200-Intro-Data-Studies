The Haunted Parlor
==================

You look on the ruined remains of the manisons parlor. Vermin have burrowed into the old plush chairs, and the huge mirror behind the bar lies in shattered pieces on the floor.

As you survey the scene, you keep feeling like you are seeing things at the edge of your vision- like something is hidden here just out of sight.
