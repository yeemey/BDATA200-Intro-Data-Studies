Heya! I'm supposed to say where I'm going because I guess you all think I'm a big baby or something. 

Anyway, I'm gonna take my bike and go explore that old spooky mansion on the edge of town.
Everyone always says its haunted, but I'm not afraid!

p.s. No, I'm not bringing my raincoat.

p.p.s.s. And where are my socks?? I'm going out all mistmatched cuz I can't find a pair. If you're hiding them it's not funny.
