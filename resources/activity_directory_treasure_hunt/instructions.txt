INSTRUCTIONS
============


Little Brother is missing! He must have run off in last night's storm.

This is a little treasure hunt to practice using basic linux commands. Basically there are a bunch of foldersand text files marked up like aa choose your own adventure story. 

GOAL
====
Check out the folders. You may want to read the stuff in the home_sweet_home folder and the_zoo first.


Useful commands
===============

A quick reminder of some useful commands:

#see what's in the current folder
ls

#see what's in a subfolder of your current directory (without moving there)
ls my_folder

#see what's in the current folder....including all the neat hidden stuff
ls -a 
ls -a my_folder

#print working directory. Shows the full path to the folder where you are
pwd 

#change directory. Move to another directory
cd 

#move something (like a text file or directory) from one place to another.
mv [from] [to]

#move a file up one directory
mv my_file.txt ../  

#move a file into a subfolder of your current directory
mv my_file.txt my_folder


Opening files with the vim text editor
======================================
#Open a text file
vim my_file.txt

#Move the cursor
(use arrowkeys, not the mouse)

#quit vim (from inside vim)
:q

#Vim has different modes you can enter.

#enter insertion (typing) mode (from inside vim)
i
#You'll see -- INSERT -- at the bottom of your screen

#exit a mode
(hit esc)

#delete a line
dd

#delete two lines
2dd

#delete 10 lines
10dd

#paste a deleted line (it will appear below the cursor)
p

#save 
:w

#save and quit
:wq
#Go to top of document
gg

#Go to bottom of document
GG


Special shorthands
==================

#There are some special shorthands for directories you can use when running bash commands

#the current directory
.

#the directory one level up
..

#your home directory
~

Examples using shorthands
=========================

#Move yourself up one directory
cd ..

#Look at the directory one level up
ls ../

#Move a file one level up
mv my_file.txt ../

#Move a file two levels up
mv my_file.txt ../../

#Move a file to a new location (starting at your home directory)

mv my_file.txt ~/start_here/folder1/folder2/whatever/more_folders/put_it_here/


A note on tab completion
========================

If you're in an environment where tab completion is enabled, you can type part of a filename, then hit the tab key to finish it.
This is awesome since it saves lots of typing, and avoids spelling errors. It really helps with long filenames.  Check out the 'mire_of_filename_madness' to practice this on a particularly obnoxious filename.
