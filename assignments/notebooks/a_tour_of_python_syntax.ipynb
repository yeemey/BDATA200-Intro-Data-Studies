    "Like our tour of python data types, this chapter **is not** intended to teach you how to use all this syntax. We'll cover each of these types of syntax in later chapters in the context of specific biological examples. Right now, I just want us to get a 'birds-eye' overview of some of the features of python. \n",

    "#### Goals for this section\n",
    "After completing this chapter, and running all the **try it yourself** exercises, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Explain in general terms what `for` loops, `if` statements and `def`initions of custom functions do, and why one might want to use each\n",
    "- Identify when a piece of code is using a `for` loop, `if` statement, or function `def`inition - even if you don't yet understand what all the rest of the code is doing.\n",

    "- If you are just learning python, I would not expect anyone to already know how to write their own `for` loops, `if` statements or function `def`initions from this chapter alone. Of course, if you are feeling brave you are welcome to try these out.  Just don't get frustrated if they don't work out for you just yet.\n",
    "- It's not expected from this chapter that you will remember all the details of syntax discussed in the chapter. This comes with practice. Don't worry - we will practice these skills by applying them to biological problems in later chapters."

    "# Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "When we learn anything complex, we tend to break it up into chunks. For example, if you are learning a new social dance you might learn one or more basic steps and simple turns before building up to more complex patterns or revisiting introductory movements to improve form, connection, and musicality. When you learned math, you built on fundamental ideas like how addition and subtraction work to learn more advanced topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python (and nearly all other programming languages), functions are a key way of breaking up your ideas into reusable 'chunks'. You can think of each function like a machine that has certain inputs, and given those inputs produces a predictable output. For instance, a sewing machine can sew a wide variety of different fabrics and threads. On many sewing machines, there are additional features you can adjust, like the thread tension or the specific foot you are using. Given some combination of fabric, thread, and settings, the sewing machine will then stitch the fabric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python functions work similarly. Some can work without any adjustment. Others have required **arguments** that are specified based on order and/or optional **keyword arguments** specified by name. From those arguments and keyword arguments, the function will then **return** one or more different results.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Calling functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Many functions are 'built-in' and come with python. Extra functions from special libraries can also be accessed by using `import` statements.\n",

    "You can tell when python code is calling a function because it will have the name of that function followed by parentheses (). `print` is one of the most commonly used built-in python functions. It prints text to the screen. What it prints depends on what **arguments** you pass to the `print` function. Here is an example:"

If you were doing an ecological simulation involving ducks, you might write a class that defines what a duck is and what it can do. This involves telling python you want to make a new class using the `class` keyword, and then defining what that class can do by defining special functions called `class methods`. These are just like other functions (as described above), except that they take a special keyword called `self` as the first argument. This tells the function which example or *instance* of the class they belong to. One special `class method` typically has the odd-looking name `__init__` (`init` is short for `initialize` or set up). That method tells the class how to set up a new instance of the class.\n",

    "\n",
    "How can we tie together all of this new information and make it easier to start to learn? One way is to look for common patterns. There are some important commonalities in all the different types of python syntax we discussed in these examples. These include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each starts with a special keyword: every `for` loop starts with the keyword `for`, every `if` statement starts with `if`, every function `def`inition starts with `def` and every class definition starts with `class`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The end of a line that defines a `for` loop, `if` statement, function definition or class definition ends with a colon `:`. The indented block of code that goes after the colon defines what is repeated by a `for` loop, what happens if the Boolean expression of an `if` statement evaluates to `True`, what a function does, and what methods and properties a `class` has.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Indentation - the number of spaces before a line of code - is used to organize python code. Unlike many programming languages where indentation is a personal choice, in python indentation is a key part of the syntax. How many spaces you put before your code (the 'level of indentation') helps python to tell which code is part of an `if` statement, `for` loop, function, or class. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In `class` definitions, there are two levels of indentation. The contents of the class are indented once relative to surrounding code, and the code for each class method is indented one more time. We will see later that it is common in python to combine different types of syntax, and use multiple levels of indentation to create more complex code. This can allow you to create nested structures such as an `if` statement within a `for` loop, a `for` loop within a function `def`inition, or a `for` loop inside another `for` loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "While revisiting each of these types of syntax, keeping these similarities in mind may make them easier to learn. You can focus on looking for keywords, where colons go, and the level of indentation. \n",
